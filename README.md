# HGCAL_OGP-DB_Tester
This Code is built as a testing apparatus for "AutoDB" (cmu_hgc_mac/HGCAL_OGP_DB). This code is meant to test the accuracy of the offset calculations for all partial shapes by spoofing the OGP survey files. 

Untill I have more time to better discribe how to use this code:
    To use this, you run RunDiagnosticsV1.py. 
    Best used in an IDE.
